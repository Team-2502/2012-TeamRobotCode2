This is the code for Team 2502's robot. It still needs some structure, but is beginning to take shape.
Our code natively supoprts three different kinds of joysticks, and (soon) two drive trains.
We've also got a nice scrolling Driver Station LCD.

Here are instructions for setting up a build system on Linux:

0) Make sure your $PROJECT_BASE environment variable is set to this directory.
1) Download "build_system.zip" from the repository page on GitHub.
2) Unzip its contents into a folder at the same level as this repository's folder on your HD.
   Your directory structure should look like:
		./build_system
          |-gnu
          |-WPILib
		  |-etc..
		./TeamRobotCode
		  |-[Code]
3) Open a terminal and go to the TeamRobotCode directory.
4) Run the commands:
	a) cp ../build_system/scripts/build .
	b) cp ../build_system/scripts/deploy .
	c) chmod +x build deploy
5) Ensure that WINE is installed (check your distro's repository.)
6) To compile run: ./build
7) To upload to the robot run: ./deploy

Easy! :D
