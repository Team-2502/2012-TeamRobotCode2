This is the code that we can use to control the 2010 Robot's Pneumatic System, and Mecanum Drive Train.
There is some debugging code left, and is an example of a crude hack. //It was written in an afternoon.
Use for testing your build system only.

Change this README when real code is committed. 

Here are instructions for setting up a build system on Linux:

1) Download "build_system.zip" from the repository page on GitHub.
2) Unzip its contents into a folder at the same level as this repository's folder on your HD.
   Your directory structure should look like:
		./build_system
          |-gnu
          |-WPILib
		  |-etc..
		./TeamRobotCode
		  |-[Code]
3) Open a terminal and go to the TeamRobotCode directory.
4) Run the commands:
	a) cp ../build_system/scripts/build .
	b) cp ../build_system/scripts/deploy .
	c) chmod +x build deploy
5) Ensure that WINE is installed (check your distro's repository.)
6) To compile run: ./build
7) To upload to the robot run: ./deploy

Easy! :D
